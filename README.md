# Pong-Game
This is a repository for the final project for Computer Programming 1 class. The project is called Pong Game and is made with processing. The goal of the game is to try and survive for as long as possible. You start with 5 health and once that turns 0, you lose. To win, gain 10 points. Once the score reaches 5, the difficulty will be set to level 2, which involves a faster moving ball. This is a solo project created by Michael Wu.
